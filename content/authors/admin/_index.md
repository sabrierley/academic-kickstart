I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

I work in the field of comparative politics, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.  My research investigates state development, political corruption, and parties and campaigns in new democracies. In my book project, I ask why bureaucrats engage in corruption on behalf of politicians. I argue that public servants do so when politicians retain discretionary control over their careers. Methodologically, I combine data from surveys and experiments, with analysis of administrative data, and qualitative information from in-depth interviews. 

In other ongoing projects, I investigate the influence of traditional leaders during elections, the role of party brokers, and public attitudes towards petty corruption. 

My research has been published in the _Journal of Politics_, _American Journal of Political Science_, _British Journal of Political Science_, _Electoral Studies_, _African Affairs_, and the _Journal of Contemporary African Studies_.
