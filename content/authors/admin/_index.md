I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

I study comparative politics and the political economy of development, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.  My research investigates state development, governance, corruption, and parties and campaigns in young democracies. In my book project, I investigate politicians' decisions to professionalize the state and their strategies to enhance bureaucratic competence while retaining loyalty. Methodologically, I adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining data from surveys and experiments with analysis of administrative data and qualitative information from in-depth interviews. 

In other ongoing projects, I investigate the influence of traditional leaders during elections, the role of party brokers, and public attitudes toward anti-corruption pledges and transparency reforms. 

My research has been published or is forthcoming in the _American Journal of Political Science_, _Journal of Politics_, _Annual Review of Political Science_, _Comparative Political Studies_, _British Journal of Political Science_, among other outlets.
